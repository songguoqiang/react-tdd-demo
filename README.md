# README

This is a project for people to practice React component development with Test-Driven-Development (TDD).

## Project Configuration

The project is configured with the following tools.

### Component Testing

- react-testing-library
- jest-prop-type-error

### End-to-End Testing

- Cypress
- cypress-testing-library

### Component Development

- Storybook

### Code Formatter/Linter

- eslint
- prettier

### npm scripts

TODO: explain the commands available

### Upgrade create-react-app version

You need to update the version of 'eslint' in devDependencies section accordingly to use the same version required by react-scripts.

## Workshop Instructions

This workshop is inspired by this [blog post]((https://medium.com/flatiron-labs/creating-readable-tests-using-react-testing-library-2bd03c49c284)) which shows how to develop a React application with TDD approach.

I roughly followed the same steps in the blog post, and refined a bit based on my taste. I also added story book to help styling the components.

You can check out the comment history to see the step-by-step changes from scratch.

If you would like to repeat the steps by yourself, you can start with a [starter project](https://github.com/songguoqiang/react-tdd-starter) I created.
